# The Weakest Link – Product Specification

## 1. Overview

The Weakest Link is a desktop, pass-and-play trivia game for groups. The app facilitates gameplay by displaying questions, tracking rounds, managing timers, handling life deductions after offline voting, and declaring a winner. All answering and voting happen offline. The app focuses solely on pacing, structure, and state management.

This document summarizes scope, flows, UI expectations, and technical behaviors based on the latest wireframes.

## 2. Core Principles

- Simple, fast gameplay suitable for a single shared device.
- No scoring, correctness tracking, or online play.
- Timer cues urgency but never auto-advances or affects gameplay outcomes.
- Voting and answering are handled verbally by players; the app only updates state.

---

## 3. Gameplay Rules

### Player Setup

- Minimum players: 2.
- Maximum players: fixed by implementation but assumed to be reasonable (e.g., 10 to 12).
- Each player starts with 3 lives (default).

### Rounds

- Default rounds: 2.
- Each round, every active player receives 3 questions.
- Order of players answering is randomized each round.
- Eliminated players (0 lives) do not participate in subsequent rounds.

### Questions

- Questions and answers are delivered from the backend.
- Frontend does not parse CSV and does not validate question count.
- If backend provides fewer questions than required, reuse is acceptable; the backend guarantees enough items to serve the session.

### Voting

- At the end of each round, players vote offline.
- A single player must be selected before proceeding.
- Timer is informational only and does not unblock progression.
- Once a player is selected, their life count is reduced by one.
- If a player reaches zero lives, they are eliminated.
- If fewer than two players remain, the game ends and the last remaining player wins.

## 6. UI Guidelines

- Desktop-first design.
- Clean, minimal UI.
- Lives shown using heart icons.
- Timers visible but non-blocking.
- Round and question numbers clearly displayed.

---

## 7. State Management

### Session State

- Lives per player.
- Current round.
- Current player answering.
- Current question index.
- Eliminated players.

### Persistence

- Safe to store in sessionStorage.

---

## 8. Game Engine Logic

### Question Allocation

- Backend provides required number of questions and answers.
- If not enough, backend duplicates question entries as needed.
- Frontend receives a complete set per session.

### Player Order

- Shuffle active players at the start of each round.

### Lives and Elimination

- Each confirmed vote deducts exactly one life.
- Players with 0 lives are removed from the next round.
- On elimination reducing count to one, game ends immediately.

---

## 9. Timers

- Question timer: visual countdown only.
- Voting timer: visual countdown only; does not advance flow.

---

## 10. Edge Cases

- No name entered: block progression.
- Duplicate names: allowed unless gameplay requires uniqueness.
- If a user tries to proceed without selecting a player during voting: block and show reminder.
- If fewer than 2 players at the start of any round: skip round and declare winner.

---

## 11. Success Criteria

Gameplay should:

- Be easy to operate with minimal instructions.
- Match wireframes closely.
- Never confuse players about whose turn it is.
- Never auto-eliminate due to timer expiration.
- Handle elimination and winner declaration cleanly.
- Never block progression during voting unless no player is selected.
